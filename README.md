# Developing a Dynamic Network-Based Model for COVID-19

Authors: Christie Wilce, Ella Mattinen, Marcell Veiner

We describe a dynamic network-based approach for modeling the spread of COVID-19. Building
onto existing models, we introduce governmental measures in the form of quarantine in addition to
data for the virus such as reinfection, death and vaccination rate. We found that the use of realistic
parameters in our model resulted in a curve following a similar trend to that of real UK data for
the virus.
